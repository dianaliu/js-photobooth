### TODO
- Add tests
- Fix error message not displaying after quota exceeded

- Use Twitter [update with media API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/statuses/update_with_media) to tweet pics
- Use node with browserify for getusermedia?
- Serve pages off node?
- Camera on mobile? - nope, just like opera.
- Auto gif videos?
- Obfuscate urls - user and photo number. Add guids or use usernames? checkout https://github.com/norman/friendly_id
- Individual page has next and previous buttons to users photos
- Add format.png for download link on photo#show
- Don't make user log in to take and save imgs, create anons - would they have delete permission then? or auto delete from server after x minutes? scheduler.
- tweet button script blocks loading of page, esp when many
- disable turbolinks so ember will work
- clean up commits
- use rails-api gem
- visualization and graphics libs like raphael and d3
- Modernizr? for getUserMedia?
