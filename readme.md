## About
I had the glorious [Lisa Frank camera app] (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lisa-frank-pic-n-share/id525555615?mt=8) but v1.1 kept on crashing on me so I decided to make a web version so I'd never be without Panda Painter&reg; or Emerald&trade; again.

## How to run locally
Must be served from a server to allow access to blobs (local storage for now) or use Chrome tags to enable.
